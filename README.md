# Getting Started:
No need for VirtualBox or Vagrant!

All that is needed is the Docker [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/ "Get Started with Docker for Mac")/[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/ "Get Started with Docker for Windows") desktop client.

Installing the desktop client includes [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "Docker Compose")

## Let do this!

To use:
`git clone https://github.com/bigbassroller/wordpress-docker-compose my-project-name && cd my-project-name`

Then:
`docker-compose up -d`

Wait a moment, as it will take 30 seconds for Docker to install MariaDB and connect the WordPress container to it. 

You can see the status of the WordPress container and know when its ready by typing (replace 'my-project-name' with the current working directory or run `docker ps` to see the name of the container):
`docker logs my-project-name1_wordpress_1 --follow`

This will create a `wordpress` directory with a local copy of WordPress and `env` folder for the MariaDB. Now you will have a local hard copy of your WordPress files and database.

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see your brand spanking new WordPress site!

## Helpful commands:
### stop all containers:
`docker kill $(docker ps -q)`

### remove all containers:
`docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)`

### remove all docker images:
`docker rmi $(docker images -q)`

### all you can special move:
`docker kill $(docker ps -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rmi $(docker images -q) && docker-compose up -d && docker logs wordpress -f`
